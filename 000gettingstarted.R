# This is the first draft of a guide to use lidR 2.0.0, the new version of the lidR package
# At the moment, lidR 2.0.0 is in the development stage, so you might come across bugs and problems
# In fact, you'll probably run in to problems at every stage of the way

# Once the package gets to a stable version, we will be able to make the process much smoother
# but for now, let's pretend that the frustration is making you a better programmer
# ...ha ha

# This document will act as an index as we move through the guide
# If you run into any problems as you go (you will)
# visit this page: https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/wiki
# or this page: https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/issues/177
# or the lidR documentation

# Okay. Lets start by opening 001updatingpackages.R to get started
